### Hi there, I'm AndrÃ©! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Backend Software Engineer passionate about building robust and scalable solutions in the fintech industry.

Currently, I work at a payment institution where I develop and maintain high-performance transactional systems, processing over **5 million payments daily**. I have hands-on experience implementing strategic projects aligned with innovations in the Brazilian financial system, such as **PIX AutomÃ¡tico** and **Open Finance**, using technologies like Java, Spring, and AWS.

My professional journey has given me a broad perspective across different sectors (Agribusiness, Education, and Finance) and specialized knowledge in architectures like **Hexagonal Architecture** and **Modular Monoliths**.
