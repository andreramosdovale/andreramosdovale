### Hi there, I'm André! 👋

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer at Positivo Tecnologia**, working as a **Full Stack Developer** in an **EdTech environment**, where I help build **scalable, gamified educational solutions** that enhance learning through technology.

My background includes designing and developing **robust, high-performance systems** across multiple industries, with strong experience in **finance, education, and large-scale platforms**.

Currently, my work focuses on:

- 🎮 Building **gamified educational platforms** that combine engagement, performance, and scalability.
- 🧠 Designing solutions with a strong focus on **software architecture, maintainability, and clean code**.
- ⚙️ Developing full-stack applications using modern backend and frontend technologies.
- ☁️ Leveraging **cloud-native architectures on AWS** to deliver reliable and scalable systems.

Previously, I worked on **mission-critical financial systems**, contributing to platforms that processed **millions of transactions daily**, and participated in strategic initiatives aligned with the Brazilian financial ecosystem, such as **PIX** and **Open Finance**.

My professional journey has given me a broad perspective across **EdTech, Fintech, and Agribusiness**, with solid experience in architectural patterns like **Modular Monoliths**, **Hexagonal Architecture**, and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**.
